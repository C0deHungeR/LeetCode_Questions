# LeetCode Solutions: Brute Force, Better, and Optimal Approaches

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is solved using three different approaches:
- **Brute Force**: A straightforward but possibly inefficient approach.
- **Better Approach**: A solution that improves on the brute force method.
- **Optimal Approach**: The most efficient solution in terms of time and space complexity.

The goal is to demonstrate progression from basic problem-solving strategies to the most optimized solutions.

## Repository Structure
Each problem has its own folder containing:
- **Brute force solution** (`brute_force.cpp`)
- **Better solution** (`better_solution.cpp`)
- **Optimal solution** (`optimal_solution.cpp`)
- A **README file** with a description of the problem, solution explanation, and time/space complexities.


## How to Use This Repository
- Each folder corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem.
- In each folder, youâ€™ll find three different solutions: brute force, better, and optimal.
- Each folder also contains a README with a description of the problem and solution explanations.

## Problem-Solving Approach
- **Brute Force**: Simple approach focusing on solving the problem, typically with higher time complexity.
- **Better Solution**: Optimizes either time or space complexity.
- **Optimal Solution**: Leverages advanced techniques like dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, or efficient data structures to achieve the best possible time and space complexity.
